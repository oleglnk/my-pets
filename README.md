## Tic-Tac-Toe

## Tetris

This a tetris for Windows terminal. It was a task for job interview. However source code was lost. Thanks to my friend who saved binary file when tested it.
Controls:
- A - move left
- D - move right
- S - move down faster
- Space - rotate

## Battleship game

This is implementation for Battleship game.
It was created a long time ago for someone's (not mine, I remember whom, but I won't tell anyone) educational purposes.
I had big plans for this project and all other projects which I created, but I realized that I don't want to change them at all.

If you want to download and test it, then you should go to project's [release section](https://github.com/oleglnk/battleship-game/releases) on Github.

## Fractals

These are my old projects about fractals, that I creaated for someone at college.
There were a lot of projects about fractals, but I have only two of them now.
I'm very upset because you can make fractals very beautiful using different settings e.g. Julia Set.

If you want to download and test them, then you should go to project's [release section](https://github.com/oleglnk/fractals/releases) on Github.

## Audio Editors

This my old projects about audio editing. They were created as course and diploma projects at college.
I look at code and it is awful. However they bring up a lot of good memories of those times. So I decided don't touch them.

If you want to download them go to project's [release section](https://github.com/oleglnk/audio-editors/releases) on Github.
