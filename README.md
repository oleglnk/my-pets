# Description

## Slaphappy Bird

[![GitLab](https://img.shields.io/badge/gitlab-%23181717.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab&logoColor=color)](https://gitlab.com/oleglnk/slaphappy-bird/-/releases)
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/oleglnk/my-pets/releases/tag/SlaphappyBird)

This is educational project for Harvard CS50's Introduction to Game Development course.
It is Fifty-bird (Flappy bird like) game which is used in Lecture 1 of course. It's written in `Lua` with `LOVE 2D` framework, 
`push` and `class` libraries. It's based on [original Harvard's implementation](https://github.com/games50/fifty-bird), 
but I implemented it by myself step-by-step for better Lua and Game structure understanding.

This is one more impementation of popular game Tic-Tac-Toe written on C. This project was created for educational proposes (first of all for me and maybe someone else who will be interested in this) and experiments. The most interesting part of the project for programmers is minimax algorithm
[wiki link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). Also the project supports Windows and Linux.

This is implementation for Battleship game.
It was created a long time ago for someone's (not mine, I remember whom, but I won't tell anyone) educational purposes.
I had big plans for this project and all other projects which I created, but I realized that I don't want to change them at all.

## Fractals

These are my old projects about fractals, that I creaated for someone at college.
There were a lot of projects about fractals, but I have only two of them now.
I'm very upset because you can make fractals very beautiful using different settings e.g. Julia Set.

This my old projects about audio editing. They were created as course and diploma projects at college.
I look at code and it is awful. However they bring up a lot of good memories of those times. So I decided don't touch them.
