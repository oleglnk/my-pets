## Audio Editors

This my old projects about audio editing. They were created as course and diploma projects at college.
I look at code and it is awful. However they bring up a lot of good memories of those times. So I decided don't touch them.

If you want to download them go to project's [release section](https://gitlab.com/oleglnk/audio-editors/-/releases) on Github.
